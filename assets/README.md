## 🎮 How It Works

### Current State (No Sprites Yet)
The game uses simple drawn graphics (basic shapes).

### After Adding Sprites
The game automatically loads and uses your PNG images!

### Mix & Match
You can add sprites one at a time:
- Add `warrior.png` → Warrior uses image, others still drawn
- Add more later → Game updates automatically
