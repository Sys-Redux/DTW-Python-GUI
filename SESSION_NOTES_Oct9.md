## 🔧 Technical Improvements

### Code Structure Changes
1. **GameState.__init__()**: Added visual effect lists and harvesting tracker
2. **Enemy.update()**: Now accepts game_state parameter for visual feedback
3. **Enemy.attack()**: Creates damage numbers and particles
4. **World.update_enemies()**: Passes game_state to enemy updates
5. **Player class**:
   - Added ability system attributes
   - Class-specific stat initialization
   - `use_ability()` method with all class mechanics
   - `update_abilities()` for cooldown management
6. **Visual Effect Updates**: Called in main update loop
7. **Control Hints**: Updated to show F-key ability

### Performance Considerations
- Particles auto-cleanup after lifetime expires
- Damage numbers removed after fade-out
- Progress bar only renders when actively harvesting
- Tooltip only draws when mouse hovering over recipe

- Particle colors match resource/action types
- Ability cooldown UI matches game's dark theme
- Progress bars use intuitive color gradient (green→red)
- Tooltips maintain consistent 40,40,50 background color

### User Experience Improvements

## 🔍 Code Quality

### Best Practices Followed
- ✅ Type hints for method parameters
- ✅ Descriptive variable names
- ✅ Docstrings for all new methods
- ✅ DRY principle (reusable add_particles method)
- ✅ Single Responsibility Principle for methods
- ✅ Error handling for missing game objects

### Areas for Future Refactoring
- Consider moving visual effects to separate class
- Ability system could use strategy pattern
- Tooltip rendering could be componentized
- Particle system could support more effect types
