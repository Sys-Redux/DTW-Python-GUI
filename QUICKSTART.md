## 🎮 Your First 10 Minutes

### Step 1: Character Selection (30 seconds)
- **Press 1** for Warrior (recommended for beginners)
- **Press 2** for Mage
- **Press 3** for Archer
- **Press 4** for Paladin

**Tip:** Warrior has the most health and is most forgiving for new players!

---

### Step 2: Gather Starting Resources (2 minutes)
You spawn in the center of a Grassland biome with guaranteed resources nearby.

**Look around for:**
- 🌲 **Green trees** - Walk up and press **E** to chop
- 🪨 **Gray rocks** - Walk up and press **E** to mine
- 🌿 **Light green bushes** - Walk up and press **E** to harvest

**Goal:** Get at least **10 wood** and **5 stone**

**Controls:**
- **W/A/S/D** - Move
- **Shift** - Sprint (uses hunger)
- **E** - Gather/Interact

---

### Step 3: Craft Your First Tools (1 minute)
Press **C** to open the crafting menu.

**Craft in this order:**
1. **Axe** (3 wood, 2 stone) - Makes tree chopping 4x faster!
2. **Pickaxe** (2 wood, 3 stone) - Makes rock mining 4x faster!

**How to craft:**
1. Press **C**
2. Click on item you want
3. Item appears in your hotbar
4. Press **ESC** to close menu

---

### Step 4: Gather More Resources (3 minutes)
Now that you have tools, gathering is much faster!

**Gather:**
- 🪵 **20+ wood** - For campfire and workbench
- 🪨 **15+ stone** - For campfire and pickaxe
- 🫐 **10+ berries** - Keep your hunger up

**Pro Tip:** Click on your **Axe** in hotbar (or press **1-8**) to equip it before chopping trees!

---

### Step 5: Build Your First Campfire (1 minute)
Before night falls (watch the timer at top!), build a campfire.

1. Press **C** for crafting
2. Craft **Campfire** (5 wood, 3 stone)
3. Press **B** to enter building mode
4. Press **1** to select campfire
5. **Left click** where you want to place it
6. Press **ESC** to exit building mode

**Why?** Campfires provide:
- Light at night (you can see!)
- Sanity restoration (prevents going insane)
- Warmth (important in cold biomes)

---

### Step 6: Survive Your First Night (2 minutes)
When night falls (screen gets dark):

**DO:**
- ✅ Stay near your campfire
- ✅ Keep gathering if near campfire light
- ✅ Watch for enemies (press **Space** to attack)
- ✅ Eat berries if hunger drops below 50%

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Wander far from light (sanity drops fast!)
- ❌ Let hunger reach 0 (you'll take damage)
- ❌ Fight multiple enemies at once

---

## 🎯 Next Steps (After First Night)

### Day 2 Goals:
1. **Build a Workbench** (12 wood, 4 stone) for advanced crafting
2. **Craft a Sword** (2 wood, 4 stone) for better combat
3. **Explore nearby biomes** - Find different resources
4. **Gather iron ore** from gray mineral deposits

### Day 3-5 Goals:
1. **Build a Furnace** (15 stone, 5 coal) for smelting
2. **Smelt iron ingots** (2 iron ore + 1 coal)
3. **Craft iron tools** (much better than stone!)
4. **Build farm plots** for sustainable food

## 📊 Understanding Your Stats

**Top Left Bars:**
- ❤️ **Health (Red)** - Don't let it reach 0! Restore with healing potions
- 🍖 **Hunger (Orange)** - Eat food before it reaches 0 or you take damage
- 🧠 **Sanity (Purple)** - Stay in light at night to maintain
- 🌡️ **Temperature (Blue)** - Keep warm in cold biomes

**Warning Signs:**
- Health < 30% = Find healing NOW
- Hunger < 20% = Eat food immediately
- Sanity < 20% = Get to light source
- Temperature < 20% = Build fire or leave cold biome

---

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Wandering at night without light** - Stay near campfire!
2. **Not crafting tools early** - Axes/pickaxes are essential
3. **Ignoring hunger** - Eat before you starve
4. **Fighting without a weapon** - Craft sword or keep distance
5. **Exploring too far on day 1** - Establish base first
6. **Not building enough campfires** - Build several around base

---

## 🆘 Emergency Situations

### "I'm dying of hunger!"
- Eat berries (3 hunger each)
- Eat meat (10 hunger each)
- Craft cooked meat at campfire for 25 hunger

### "Enemies are attacking!"
- Press **Space** repeatedly to fight
- Run to campfire (enemies slower in light)
- Sprint away (**Shift**) if overwhelmed

### "I'm lost in the dark!"
- Equip torch if you have one (**press 1-8**)
- Wait for dawn (6 seconds of night)
- Build emergency campfire if you have resources

### "My tools broke!"
- Tools have durability that depletes
- Keep resources to craft new ones
- Store backup tools in hotbar

## 🎓 Key Mechanics to Learn

### Resource Gathering
- **No tool**: Slow gathering
- **Correct tool**: 4-5x faster
- **Wrong tool**: Still slow

### Biomes Matter
- **Grassland**: Safe, balanced

- **Desert**: Hot, cactus fruit
- **Swamp**: Mushrooms, dangerous

### Day/Night Cycle
