## üìù Notes

### Design Philosophy
- **Engaging Progression:** Always give player something to work toward
- **Environmental Challenge:** Weather, temperature, and biomes matter
- **Meaningful Choices:** Tools, resources, and timing decisions impact success
- **Exploration Reward:** Hidden locations and rare resources encourage exploration
- **Fair Difficulty:** Challenging but learnable, scales with player progress

### Inspiration Sources
- Don't Starve Together (survival mechanics, art style)
- Terraria (crafting progression, biome diversity)
- Minecraft (resource gathering, building freedom)
- Stardew Valley (farming mechanics, progression)

### Future Vision
Create a deeply engaging survival experience where every game session feels unique due to procedural generation, with enough depth in crafting and building to support long-term gameplay, while maintaining the simple charm of pixel art aesthetics.
